        Since beginning my journey as a freelance designer over 1 year ago, I've
        done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and collaborated
        with talented people to create digital products for both business and
        consumer use. I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually
        working on improving my chops one design problem at a time.
